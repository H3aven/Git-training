# README

## This is a manual for setup and installation for the project.

### Added additional information regarding creating branches.
To create a new branch one use git bash command git checkout -b NAMEOFTHEBRANCH.

To list all available branches one use:
git branch

To push new commits to the new branch one has to use:
git push --set-upstream origin NAMEOFTHEBRANCH

### I will no more put a descriptions of git commands as a remainder. Probably I should, but for a purpose of this training I won't.
